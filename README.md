**Abtract**
a Project generate Ground track or Grace twin satellites in matlab based on TLE file
In this task, aim is visualizing the ground track of two altimeter satellites (Grace 1 and 2),
where the basic information is obtained from Two-line Elements (TLE) file. TLE file, contains a bundle
of numbers mostly related to the orbital motion parameters of satellite.
By, extracting specific numbers from TLE file and execution certain calculations, the ground track of a
satellite could be generated for a precise period of time. Visualizing orbital motion of a satellite could 
be an expensive procedure and requires an optimized environment and code implementation to could be more 
well-organized, also, some assumptions could be made to simplify the calculations. The extraction and computations
in this task have done in Octave platform, and the implementation of codes are attached to this file.
